# Experiment-6

# Aim
The aim of this C++ code is to demonstrate the use of various looping constructs and nested loops.

# Theory
We would be discussing about various Looping Constructs

do-while Loop: Executes the code block once, then repeats as long as the condition remains true.

for Loop: Repeats code a specific number of times, based on initialization, condition, and increment.

while Loop: Repeats code as long as the specified condition is true.

Nested for Loops: Multiple for loops inside each other, often used for iterating over multi-dimensional data.

Nested do-while Loops: Multiple do-while loops within each other, executing inner blocks multiple times based on conditions.

Nested while Loops: Multiple while loops within each other, where the inner loop completes all its iterations before the outer loop continues.

Nested for Loops (Matrix): A pair of for loops used to iterate over rows and columns of a matrix.

Nested for + while Loops (Matrix with Condition): A for loop with an inner while loop to process matrix elements conditionally.
